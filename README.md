# Thoughts on building SaaS

This repository contains a compilation of thoughts on the practices of building SaaS products, seen through the lens of a Software Engineer. The content therein is drawn from personal experience, and strongly inspired by ideas of some great minds I'm following:
- [Folks at 37signals](https://37signals.com/)
- [Maarten Dalmijn](https://mdalmijn.com/)
- [Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/)
- [Gergely Orosz](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/)
- [Alex Ewerl√∂f](https://blog.alexewerlof.com/)

# Table of contents

Please note that even though there are separate pages, they all aim to express a cohesive viewpoint. I believe that the best results can be delivered by a unified product-engineering team, working towards shared goals.

1. Thoughts on [building a product](topics/product.md)
2. Helpful [engineering culture practices](topics/engineering-culture.md)
3. The patterns for [scaling for higher throughput and data volumes](topics/engineering-scaling.md)
